Hi, we have some fixes from the client to the ESET page – they are URGENT.

 

Attached are the updated PSDs and a reference PNG with the changes –

    Add logo to the corner
    2 change header text, remove logo
    Text change
    Right now, people can submit form without filling the phone field which is required (9 digits minimum)
    Text change
    Text change
    New text paragraph
    Remove text from the footer, only leave the logo

 

Thanks, and please update Ravit via Whatsapp when it’s completed
